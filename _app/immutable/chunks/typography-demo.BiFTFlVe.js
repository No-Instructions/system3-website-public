		on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out
		of money.</p> <h2 class="mt-10 scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors first:mt-0">The King&#39;s Plan</h2> <p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with
		
		<a href="#" class="font-medium text-primary underline underline-offset-4">a brilliant plan</a>
		: he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.</p> <blockquote class="mt-6 border-l-2 pl-6 italic">&quot;After all,&quot; he said, &quot;everyone enjoys a good joke, so it&#39;s only fair that they should pay
		for the privilege.&quot;</blockquote> <h3 class="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">The Joke Tax</h3> <p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">The king&#39;s subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the king was firm:</p> <ul class="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&amp;&gt;li]:mt-2"><li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li> <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li> <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li></ul> <p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was
		one person who refused to let the king&#39;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named
		Jokester.</p> <h3 class="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Jokester&#39;s Revolt</h3> <p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all
		over the place: under the king&#39;s pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was
		furious, but he couldn&#39;t seem to stop Jokester.</p> <p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were
		so funny that they couldn&#39;t help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn&#39;t
		stop.</p> <h3 class="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">The People&#39;s Rebellion</h3> <p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to tell jokes and puns
		again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the joke.</p> <div class="my-6 w-full overflow-y-auto"><table class="w-full"><thead><tr class="m-0 border-t p-0 even:bg-muted"><th class="border px-4 py-2 text-left font-bold [&amp;[align=center]]:text-center [&amp;[align=right]]:text-right">King&#39;s Treasury</th> <th class="border px-4 py-2 text-left font-bold [&amp;[align=center]]:text-center [&amp;[align=right]]:text-right">People&#39;s happiness</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr class="m-0 border-t p-0 even:bg-muted"><td class="border px-4 py-2 text-left [&amp;[align=center]]:text-center [&amp;[align=right]]:text-right">Empty</td> <td class="border px-4 py-2 text-left [&amp;[align=center]]:text-center [&amp;[align=right]]:text-right">Overflowing</td></tr> <tr class="m-0 border-t p-0 even:bg-muted"><td class="border px-4 py-2 text-left [&amp;[align=center]]:text-center [&amp;[align=right]]:text-right">Modest</td> <td class="border px-4 py-2 text-left [&amp;[align=center]]:text-center [&amp;[align=right]]:text-right">Satisfied</td></tr> <tr class="m-0 border-t p-0 even:bg-muted"><td class="border px-4 py-2 text-left [&amp;[align=center]]:text-center [&amp;[align=right]]:text-right">Full</td> <td class="border px-4 py-2 text-left [&amp;[align=center]]:text-center [&amp;[align=right]]:text-right">Ecstatic</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the error of his ways and
