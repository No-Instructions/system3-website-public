				Written by AI, needs human edit Great software requires sustainable development. As
				catalysts, our paying customers make it possible for us to maintain and improve our
				tools while keeping them accessible to everyone.
			</p>

			<h2>Our commitment to accessibility</h2>
			<p>
				We believe quality tools should be accessible to everyone. That's why we offer a
				free tier that includes core features for individuals and small teams. This isn't a
				temporary trial or limited demoâ€”it's a legitimate offering we intend to maintain
				indefinitely.
			</p>

			<h2>The reality of sustainability</h2>
			<p>
				Building and maintaining quality software requires significant ongoing investment.
				Server costs, development time, support services, and security measures all have
				real costs. Without sustainable revenue, even the best-intentioned free offerings
				eventually degrade or disappear.
			</p>

			<h2>Why "Catalyst"?</h2>
			<p>
				We chose this term carefully. A catalyst enables reactions that wouldn't happen
				otherwise. Our paying customers are catalysts who make it possible for us to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maintain and improve our free tier</li>
				<li>Develop new features for everyone</li>
				<li>Provide reliable service and support</li>
				<li>Stay independent and user-focused</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The virtuous cycle</h2>
			<p>
				When users become paying customers, they're not just buying features for themselves.
				They're enabling us to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep core features free for everyone</li>
				<li>Maintain high quality across all tiers</li>
				<li>Stay focused on user needs rather than investor demands</li>
				<li>Build toward our vision of sovereign computing</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How you can help</h2>
			<p>
				If you believe in our vision and want to support sustainable, user-focused software:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Upgrade to our Team plan if it fits your needs</li>
				<li>Share Relay with others who might benefit</li>
				<li>Give us feedback to help improve our offerings</li>
				<li>Engage with our community</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>A note on "forever"</h2>
			<p>
				You might notice we don't promise our free tier will be "free forever." While that
				sounds nice, we believe in being realistic with our users. What we do promise is
				transparency about our business model and a genuine commitment to maintaining
				accessible tools while building a sustainable company.
