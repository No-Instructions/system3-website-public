			<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold tracking-tighter">Company ideals</h1>
			<p class="mt-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
				These are the orienting principles on which our company is premised.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="mt-16 space-y-24">
			<!-- Care for the soul -->
			<div>
				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Care for the soul</h3>
				<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
					We aspire to live in a way that nourishes rather than drains the spirit. This
					company is meant to be a structure that supports life.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
					This means listening with care, moving at the right pace, and checking that our
					work energizes rather than depletes. For ourselves and our users: our role is to
					serve rather than control.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Freedom -->
			<div>
				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Freedom from capture</h3>
				<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
					Many of us have experienced the soul-crushing weight of golden handcuffs — in
					jobs, in tools, in platforms. We founded this company to support freedom — ours
					and yours.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
					This means avoiding venture funding that would force us to exploit users,
					avoiding product decisions that create lock-in, and maintaining our own freedom
					to build what's right.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Beauty -->
			<div>
				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Your interest in beauty is not trivial</h3>
				<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
					The experience of beauty is how humans make contact with something more
					important. It's not just decoration on top of substance; beauty is the sign of
					truth.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
					In our work we take our own taste seriously. In our products, we want to honor
					yours.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- No dystopia -->
			<div>
				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Doesn't extrapolate to dystopia</h3>
				<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
					We hope to nudge the universe in more positive directions. We at least don't
					want to make it worse. When extended to their imaginal conclusions, our choices
					should enhance rather than diminish human flourishing.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
					This guides our decisions about funding, features, and growth — we're
					uncomfortable if it looks like our success makes the world worse.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Philosophy -->
			<div>
				<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Philo sophia</h3>
				<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
					We are lovers of truth and builders of coherent models. We like to start from
					first principles rather than convention. Curiosity is central to our nature.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
					It's why we like Obsidian, and it informs our aspirations for the future of
					technology. Threaded, not fragmented.
