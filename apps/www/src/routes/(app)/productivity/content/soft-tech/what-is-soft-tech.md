# What is Soft Tech?

Much of the value of tools like Obsidian, Relay, and AI comes not from the software itself, but from knowing how to use it effectively. We call this human knowledge - the practices, patterns, and protocols that make tools valuable - "soft tech."

## Why Soft Tech Matters

Think about any powerful tool you've mastered:
- It wasn't just about learning the features
- It was about developing workflows
- It was about building habits
- It was about discovering what works for you

## Examples in Knowledge Work

### Personal Knowledge Management
- How to structure your notes
- When to create links
- What to capture vs what to skip
- How to review and refine

### Team Collaboration
- Conventions for shared folders
- Protocols for updates
- Patterns for async work
- Ways to maintain context

### AI Integration
- Prompting patterns that work
- Workflows that combine human and AI
- Ways to verify and improve outputs
- Methods for maintaining agency

## Developing Soft Tech

Unlike hardware or software, soft tech can't just be installed - it has to be developed through:
1. Experimentation
2. Reflection
3. Iteration
4. Sharing with others

This is why we focus not just on building tools, but on helping teams develop the soft tech they need to make those tools valuable.

## Getting Started

Consider these questions:
- What are your current practices?
- Where do you feel friction?
- What patterns have you discovered?
- What could you systematize?

The answers will help you start developing your own soft tech.
