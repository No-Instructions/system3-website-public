# Getting Started

Modern productivity tools like Obsidian and AI assistants are powerful, but they need something more than just features - they need good practices and patterns.

## What is Soft Tech?

Soft tech is about the human practices that make technical tools valuable. Much of the value of tools like Obsidian, Relay, and AI comes not from the software itself, but from knowing how to use it effectively. We call this human knowledge - the practices, patterns, and protocols that make tools valuable - "soft tech."

Think about any powerful tool you've mastered:
- It wasn't just about learning the features
- It was about developing workflows
- It was about building habits
- It was about discovering what works for you

## Key Concepts

1. Tools are only as good as your practices
2. Patterns matter more than features
3. Start simple, grow naturally
4. Focus on workflows, not just features
5. Share and learn from others
