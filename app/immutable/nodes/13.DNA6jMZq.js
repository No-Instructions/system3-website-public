This
					company is meant to be a structure that supports life.</p> <p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">This means listening with care, moving at the right pace, and checking that our
					work energizes rather than depletes. For ourselves and our users: our role is to

					jobs, in tools, in platforms. We founded this company to support freedom — ours
					and yours.</p> <p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">This means avoiding venture funding that would force us to exploit users,

					want to make it worse. When extended to their imaginal conclusions, our choices
					should enhance rather than diminish human flourishing.</p> <p class="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">This guides our decisions about funding, features, and growth — we&#39;re
